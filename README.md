# Generating-Synthetic-Images-using-DCGANs-with-Keras
This jupyter notebook builds and trains a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN) to generate artificial real looking images almost identical to the clothing images from Fashion MNIST dataset. It uses Keras and its Sequential API to generate the GAN. 
You can try running the Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb file) on your local computer, but to get a better and faster output, try running on a good GPU machine like Google Colabs.
